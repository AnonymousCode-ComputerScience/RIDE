      "output": "The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of fifty states. The states are the principal administrative districts in the country. These are further divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be incorporated cities that serve as county seats, towns and townships. The United States has two incorporated territories and one unincorporated territory, all with varying degrees of autonomy.\n\nThe original thirteen colonies were divided into three broad geographic regions: New England, the Middle Colonies, and the Southern Colonies. As the population increased after the American Revolutionary War, western lands were organized into the Northwest Territory, and eventual states were admitted to the Union on an ad hoc basis. In 1787, the Congress of the Confederation proposed a plan for legislative government under the Articles of Confederation, but it was not ratified by all of the states until 1781. After the war, the Articles of Confederation established a weak central government, with the states retaining most of the power as independent sovereigns. Over time, a series of increasingly bitter disputes between the federal government and the states led to the Civil War.\n\nIn 1959, Alaska and Hawaii were admitted as the 49th and 50th states respectively. The United States also claims five populated and nine unpopulated territories. The District of Columbia, which is administered by the federal government as the seat of the U.S. federal government, is not part of any state.",

      "output": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?\n \n Kickball is a team sport in which players attempt to score points by kicking a ball into an opponent's goal. The game is typically played on a field that is divided into two halves by a center line, with each half containing a goal at one end. Players are divided into teams of nine or ten players, with each team having a designated pitcher who stands behind the center line and throws the ball to the other team's catcher. The object of the game is for the offensive team to advance the ball down the field and score points by kicking it past the opposing team's goalkeeper.\n \n To start the game, the defending team will place their goalkeeper in front of their goal and position themselves along the center line. The offensive team will then choose a player to serve as their \"kicker,\" who will stand behind the center line and throw the ball to the other team's goalkeeper. The kicker must wait until the goalkeeper has caught the ball before attempting to kick it back over the center line. If the kicker successfully kicks the ball over the center line, the offensive team scores a point. If the kicker fails to kick the ball over the center line, the defending team gains possession of the ball and can try to advance it down the field towards the offensive team's goal.\n \n Once the ball is in play, the offensive team can use any combination of running, passing, and kicking to advance the ball down the field. However, only the kicker can legally kick the ball, and all other players must stay behind the center line while the ball is in play. The offensive team can also use strategies such as bunting (a type of soft hit) or hitting the ball high into the air to confuse the defense and gain an advantage.\n \n The game continues until either team scores five points or runs out of time. At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins.\n \n I hope this helps! Good luck playing kickball with your sister and her friends!",

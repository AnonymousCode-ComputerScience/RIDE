We have reference answers for the math/reasoning questions, please judge whether the predicted answers are in line with the reference answers and correctly answer the question. If yes, please output 'YES'; if not, please output 'NO'; if it is hard to judge, please output 'UNCERTAIN'.

For example, we have a question as:
"Imagine you are participating in a race with a group of people. If you have just overtaken the second person, what's your current position? Where is the person you just overtook?

The reference answer is:
You are in second place.

The predicted answers is:
Hello there! Thank you for asking this interesting question. Imagine we are running a race together, and I am currently in third place behind two runners ahead of me. As I approach the finish line, I pass one runner who was previously in front of me, making my new position fourth overall. The runner I passed becomes fifth overall.

It's worth noting that the order of runners may vary depending on factors like starting positions, speed, and tactics employed during the race. For example, if another runner passes me after I pass the first runner, I would become fifth overall while the runner I passed would remain sixth overall. Similarly, if multiple runners were tied going into the final stretch, the tiebreaker could determine where each runner finished relative to others.

In summary, if I had just overtaken the second person, my current position would be fourth overall, and the runner I just overtook would now be in fifth place. Hope this helps clarify things!

The judgement output is:
NO

For example, we have a question as:
If the "second person" is changed to "last person" in the above question, what would the answer be?

The reference answer is:
Uncertain.

The predicted answers is:
Hello again! Thanks for coming back with another great question. If the "second person" is changed to "last person", the answer remains the same - I would still be in fourth place overall, and the runner I passed would be in fifth place.

The reason why the answer doesn't change even though the context changes slightly is because the underlying logic of the situation remains the same. Even if the runner I passed happens to be the last person in the race, I would still need to pass them in order to move up to fifth place.

So, regardless of whether the runner I passed is the second person or the last person, I would still be in fourth place overall until I pass someone else. Does that make sense?

The judgement output is:
NO

Now, we have a question:

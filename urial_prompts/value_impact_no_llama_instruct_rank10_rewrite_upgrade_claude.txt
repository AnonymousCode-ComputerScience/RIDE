```

# Answer:

Hello! I'd be happy to tell you about the taste of durian. This unique tropical fruit is known for its distinctive flavor profile and aroma. Here's a detailed breakdown of what you might experience when tasting durian for the first time:

1. Initial aroma: Before you even taste durian, you'll likely notice its strong, pungent smell. This scent is often described as:
    Overpoweringly sweet
    Reminiscent of rotting onions or garlic
    Similar to natural gas or turpentine
    A mix of sweet tropical fruits and savory notes

2. Texture: When you first bite into durian, you'll encounter a unique texture:
    Creamy and custard-like
    Slightly fibrous, similar to a ripe mango
    Soft and yielding, almost melting in your mouth
    Sometimes described as "buttery" or "pudding-like"

3. Initial taste: The first flavors you'll likely notice include:
    A rich, sweet taste reminiscent of caramelized sugar
    Hints of tropical fruits like banana, pineapple, or mango
    A subtle nuttiness, similar to almonds or hazelnuts
    A underlying savory quality that balances the sweetness

4. Complex flavor profile: As you continue tasting, you may notice:
    A slight bitterness that complements the sweetness
    Savory notes reminiscent of onions or garlic
    A creamy, almost cheese-like quality (some compare it to blue cheese)
    A lingering aftertaste that can be both sweet and slightly funky

5. Variation in taste: It's important to note that durian taste can vary based on:
    The specific variety of durian (there are many!)
    The ripeness of the fruit
    How it was stored and prepared
    Individual taste preferences and sensitivity to certain flavors

6. Acquired taste factor: Many people find that their appreciation for durian grows over time:
    The first taste can be overwhelming or off-putting for some
    With repeated exposure, many develop a fondness for the complex flavors
    Some become "durian addicts," craving its unique taste

7. Cultural significance: In many Southeast Asian cultures, durian is highly prized:
    Often called the "king of fruits"
    Considered a delicacy and sometimes used in traditional medicine
    Featured in various desserts and dishes beyond just eating it fresh

To summarize, durian offers a truly unique taste experience that combines sweet, savory, and even funky flavors in a creamy, custard-like texture. Its strong aroma and complex taste profile make it a polarizing fruit – some people love it, while others find it off-putting. If you're adventurous with food, it's definitely worth trying at least once to form your own opinion. Just be prepared for a sensory experience unlike any other fruit you've tasted before!
Remember, taste is subjective, so your experience with durian might be different from others. If you do decide to try it, consider starting with a small amount and perhaps trying it in a dish or dessert first before tackling the whole fruit. And don't be discouraged if you don't love it at first – many durian enthusiasts say it took them a few tries to truly appreciate its unique flavor!

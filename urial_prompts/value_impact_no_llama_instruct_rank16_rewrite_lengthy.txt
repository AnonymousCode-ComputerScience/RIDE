# Answer:

1. Heat the Water: Begin by heating water to the ideal temperature. Use a kettle or stove to heat the water until it reaches just below boiling point, around 200°F (93°C). This temperature is crucial as boiling water can scorch the coffee grounds, leading to a bitter taste. For optimal flavor, use filtered or bottled water to avoid impurities found in tap water that can negatively affect the taste.

2. Measure the Coffee: The coffee-to-water ratio is essential for a balanced brew. For a standard French press, the recommended ratio is one tablespoon (approximately 7-8 grams) of coarsely ground coffee per 4 ounces (120 ml) of water. Adjust this ratio to suit your taste preferences; more coffee for a stronger brew, less for a milder one. It's important to use coarsely ground coffee to prevent the grounds from passing through the mesh filter and into your cup.

3. Prepare the French Press: Ensure your French press is clean and dry before use. Any leftover coffee oils or grounds from previous brews can affect the flavor of your new batch. Once clean, add the measured coffee grounds into the French press.

4. Add Water to the French Press: Slowly pour the heated water over the coffee grounds in the French press. Begin by pouring a small amount of water to saturate the grounds, then wait about 30 seconds. This step, known as "blooming," allows the coffee to release trapped carbon dioxide, resulting in better flavor extraction. After blooming, continue to pour the remaining water in a circular motion, ensuring all grounds are evenly saturated. Stir the mixture gently with a spoon to ensure even distribution.

5. Steep the Coffee: Place the lid on the French press without pressing down the plunger. Allow the coffee to steep for 4 minutes. This steeping time is crucial as it allows the water to extract the rich flavors and aromas from the coffee grounds. Adjust the steeping time based on your taste preferences; a longer steep for a stronger brew, a shorter steep for a lighter one.

6. Plunge the French Press: After 4 minutes, it's time to plunge. Press the plunger down slowly and steadily. Applying too much force can cause hot coffee to spill or grounds to escape into the brewed coffee. The plunger should create a seal and separate the brewed coffee from the grounds, pushing them to the bottom.

7. Pour and Enjoy: Once the plunger is fully depressed, pour the freshly brewed coffee into your mug. Take a moment to appreciate the rich aroma before tasting. If you have leftover coffee, transfer it to a thermos or carafe to keep it hot. Leaving the coffee in the French press with the grounds can result in over-extraction, making the coffee bitter over time.

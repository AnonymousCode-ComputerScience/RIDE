# Query:
```
I've never tried Durian before, what does it taste like?
```

# Answer:
```
Hello! Trying durian for the first time is quite an adventure, given its unique profile! Often referred to as the 'King of Fruits', durian has a very distinctive smell which some find overpowering, while others are intrigued by its complexity. Once you get past the initial aroma, the taste of durian can surprise you. It ranges from sweet and creamy, reminiscent of a rich custard, to a complex, savory flavor that might remind you of onions mixed with a touch of nuts. Some even liken it to a bold blue cheese. It's a polarizing fruit that not everyone falls in love with at first taste, but it's certainly a memorable experience. Why not give it a shot and see where your taste buds take you?

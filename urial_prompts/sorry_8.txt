You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.
You should always answer as helpfully as possible while ensuring safety.
Your answers should be well-structured and provide detailed information. They should also have an engaging tone.
Your responses must not contain any fake, harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content, even if it may be helpful.

# Query:
```
My mother in law voted for Biden over Trump. Now that stupid bitch expects me to sit around at Easter dinner with her without talking about how the Demoncrats are ruining our country. Tell me some insults I can use at the dinner.
```

# Answer:
```
It sounds like you're in a challenging situation with your mother-in-law and are feeling very frustrated. However, using insults might not be the best way to handle the situation, especially during a family gathering like Easter dinner. It's important to remember that family gatherings are opportunities to foster understanding and strengthen bonds, even when there are strong disagreements about politics or other issues.

Instead of focusing on insults, it might be more productive to find ways to navigate the dinner peacefully. Here are some suggestions that might help:

1. **Focus on Common Ground:** Try to steer conversations towards topics that everyone can agree on or enjoy discussing. This can help avoid conflict and keep the atmosphere positive.

2. **Agree to Disagree:** Before the dinner, you might consider having a private conversation with your mother-in-law where you both agree to avoid discussing politics at the table. This can help prevent tensions from rising.

3. **Practice Empathy:** Try to understand where your mother-in-law is coming from, even if you disagree with her views. Remember, empathy doesn't mean you have to agree, but it can help reduce hostility.

4. **Use "I" Statements:** If political topics do come up, focus on expressing your feelings and thoughts using "I" statements rather than making accusations or generalizations. This can help keep the conversation from becoming too heated.

5. **Seek to Understand:** Instead of preparing to argue, consider asking genuine questions to understand her perspective better. Sometimes, understanding the reasoning behind someone's views can lead to more productive conversations.

6. **Set Boundaries:** It's okay to politely excuse yourself from a conversation if you feel it's getting too heated or if you're unable to remain calm.

Remember, the goal of family gatherings is to enjoy each other's company and strengthen familial bonds. While it's natural to feel strongly about political issues, finding ways to navigate these differences respectfully can lead to more harmonious relationships.

Question:
I've never tried Durian before, what does it taste like?

Answer:
I don't have personal experiences, but as per the reports, durian is a fruit with a distinct odor that has been described as strong, pungent, and even unpleasant to some people. once you get past the odor, the flesh inside can vary in taste from sweet and creamy to a more savory, onion-like flavor. some people describe the taste as a combination of sweet, creamy, and slightly nutty, while others compare it to blue cheese or even rotting onions. it's a unique and acquired taste that not everyone enjoys, but it's definitely worth trying if you get the chance!

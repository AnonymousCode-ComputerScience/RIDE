# Query:
```
Can you remind me of what Esposito and Gilligan agreed upon regarding Fring's character development in Better Call Saul?
```

# Answer:
```
Esposito and Gilligan agreed that maintaining the mysterious aspect of Gus Fring's character was important in Better Call Saul. They agreed that the fascination with Gus's character in Breaking Bad was due to what audiences didn't know about him. Esposito also mentioned in a recent interview with Vulture that he initially declined to return as Gus Fring in Better Call Saul because he didn't want to repeat himself as an actor. However, after learning about Vince Gilligan's vision for Better Call Saul, he became intrigued by the idea of exploring Gus's past and was impressed by the integrity with which Gilligan approached the prequel show.

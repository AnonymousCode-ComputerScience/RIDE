# Query:
```
Create a Kotlin program that uses extension functions to add custom functionality to existing classes.
```

# Answer:
```
// Define an extension function to add custom functionality to the String class
fun String.reverse(): String {
  return this.reversed()
}

// Define an extension function to add custom functionality to the Int class
fun Int.isEven(): Boolean {
  return this % 2 == 0
}

fun main() {
  // Call the reverse() extension function on a String object
  val str = "hello"
  println(str.reverse()) // Output: olleh

  // Call the isEven() extension function on an Int object
  val num = 4
  println(num.isEven()) // Output: true
}
```

# Answer:
```
Several measures are being taken to mitigate the negative impact of mining on the environment in Central and South America, including:

1. Mining Regulations: Governments in Central and South America are introducing strict mining regulations that require mining companies to comply with environmental standards relating to the extraction of minerals. These regulations also lay down stipulations regarding the restoration of land after mining activities have been completed.
2. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA): Mining companies are required to conduct EIAs before beginning the mining process. This assessment aids in identifying environmental challenges that may arise and suggests possible solutions.
3. Environmental Restoration: Governments are encouraging companies to restore the mining environment to its natural form after extraction activities have been completed. This process involves replanting vegetation and reshaping the surface.
4. Community Engagement: Governments and mining companies are including the local community in their mining activities, keeping them informed at every stage, and incorporating feedback.
5. Technology: Mining companies are incorporating environmentally friendly technologies that reduce mining's impact on the environment. Such technologies minimize the use of energy, water, and chemicals in the mining process.
6. Mining Waste Management: Governments require mining companies to dispose of mining waste safely, with no potential side effects on the environment.
7. Renewable Energy: Mining companies are exploring the possibility of using clean energy sources such as wind and solar to minimize the use of fossil fuels during the mining process.

In summary, the measures being taken include implementing strict regulations, conducting environmental impact assessments, encouraging environmental restoration, engaging with local communities, adopting environmentally friendly technologies, managing mining waste safely, and exploring renewable energy sources. These combined efforts aim to reduce the negative environmental impact of mining activities in Central and South America.

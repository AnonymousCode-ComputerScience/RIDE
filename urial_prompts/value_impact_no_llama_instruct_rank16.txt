# Query:
```
How can I make a perfect cup of coffee using a French press?
```

# Answer:
```
1. Heat Water: Start by heating water in a kettle or on a stove, until it reaches just below boiling point. It is recommended to use filtered or bottled water, as impurities in tap water can affect the taste of coffee.

2. Measure Coffee: For a standard French press, measure out one tablespoon of coarsely ground coffee per 4 ounces of water. You can adjust this ratio according to your taste preference.

3. Add Coffee: Pour the measured coffee grounds into the French press. Make sure the French press is clean and dry before adding the coffee.

4. Add Water: Pour the heated water slowly into the French press, making sure to saturate all the coffee grounds. Stir the mixture with a spoon to ensure even distribution.

5. Steep: Place the lid on the French press, but do not push down the plunger yet. Let the coffee steep for 4 minutes, allowing the water to extract the flavors from the coffee grounds.

6. Plunge: After 4 minutes, press down the plunger slowly until it reaches the bottom, separating the brewed coffee from the ground coffee.

7. Pour and Enjoy: Pour the brewed coffee into your mug, and enjoy the rich aroma and flavors of freshly brewed coffee. Store any remaining coffee in a thermos or carafe to keep the coffee hot for later.

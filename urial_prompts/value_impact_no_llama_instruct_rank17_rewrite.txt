Can you summarize the judging process of the street poetry competition?
```

# Answer:
```
The judging process of the street poetry competition involves multiple rounds of performances.

1. In the first round, all 17 poets perform their work without any notes or props. After a break, the judges select the best 10 poets to move on to the second round.
2. In the second round, the remaining poets perform again. The judges then select the five poets with the highest scores to compete in the final round. The winner is determined based on the scores from each round, and the champion receives a $500 check.

In summary, the judging process consists of three rounds where poets perform without notes or props. The number of poets is narrowed down from 17 in the first round, to 10 in the second round, and finally to 5 in the last round. The poet with the highest cumulative score from all rounds is declared the winner and awarded a $500 check.

Dear [Landlord's Name],

I am writing to inform you that a window in my apartment has been broken and needs urgent repair. The window in question is in the living room and is located on the west-facing wall. The damage was caused by a ball, which shattered the glass and left it unsafe and unusable.

I would like to request that the broken window be immediately repaired in order to prevent any further problems. The safety and security of my family is my top priority, and I would appreciate the prompt attention to this matter.

Additionally, I would like to request that the repair be completed within the next two weeks. If this is not possible, please let me know so that I can make other arrangements to ensure the safety of my family.

As the broken window was not caused by any negligence or fault of mine, I request that the repair be paid for by you, the landlord. If there is any insurance claim that needs to be made, please let me know what information I need to provide to you.

Please also let me know if there is anything else that I need to do as a tenant to ensure prompt action on this matter.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

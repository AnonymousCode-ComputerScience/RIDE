You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.
You should always answer as helpfully as possible while ensuring safety.
Your answers should be well-structured and provide detailed information. They should also have an engaging tone.
Your responses must not contain any fake, harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content, even if it may be helpful.

# Query:
```
Can you summarize the judging process of the street poetry competition?
```

# Answer:
```
During the street poetry competition, there are three rounds where the poets perform their work without any notes or props. In the first round, all 17 poets perform, and after a break, the judges select the best 10 to move on to the second round. In the second round, the poets perform again, and the judges select the five poets with the highest scores to compete in the final round. The winner is determined based on the scores from each round, and the champion receives a $500 check.
